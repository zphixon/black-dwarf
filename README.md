*a highly-opinionated build system for C*

Since the early '90s, C has been deliriously wasting away like a half-dead
*Triceratops* after a nasty encounter with a *Tyrannosaurus*. People have been
attempting to prod its bloated, anemic near-corpse along with tools like make
and autoconf, but it's really only a matter of time until the roving bands of
*Albertosaurus* take it down for good.
